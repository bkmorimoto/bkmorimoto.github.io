          <h3>What is pair programming?</h3>
          Pair programming is the process of working with one other developer on a single project. One of the benefits of pair programming is that it helps reduce errors that might occur if one was working by oneself. Also, having another person to bounce ideas off of is advantageous because you might come up with an idea that is even better than what only either individual could have accomplished. It also helps keep each person in check when working, because you need to be able to justify your code as you collaborate.

          <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
          It is important because pair programming is getting to be a more common practice in this industry. We might find ourself in a position in the future where we have to pair program, and it is good to be able to practice it now while we are also learning to program. Also, by doing this during DBC, it keeps us socializing with each other. We get to learn how other people work, and it is important to be able to adapt to someones work style to be productive if needed. Another important aspect of pair programming in DBC is getting the feedback from your pair. That way you can work on how you interact with other people and adjust where necessary.

          <h3>Compare Driver and Navigator</h3>
          The navigator takes the role that is looking at the map, thinking about the big picture, and where the project is going. They want to make sure the work is focused and does not stray from what is actually tying to be accomplished. The Driver is the one that is actually doing the writing the code, must be sure to be engaged with the navigator, and comment when appropriate. In either role, communication with each other is the key to be productive and successful.

<!-- Reflection
I did not have a student pair this week. I worked directly with my guide, Armando Reed, as a pseudo-pair. He let me do the majority of the driving and helped keep me on track with there we were going with the project. I definitely felt more comfortable because it was less of a student-teacher interaction, and more of a peer-to-peer interaction (he just knew more than me). It was also easy to ask lingering questions I had about html/css coding styles and to get some tips and tricks from someone who has done some more html/css work than the average DBC student. I think we were able to get through the learning competencies fairly well, and I really enjoyed our conversation that we had about pair programming and the benefits of it.
