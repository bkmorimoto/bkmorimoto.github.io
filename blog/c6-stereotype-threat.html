        <p>The culture topic that I want to address is a little foreign to me, but I want to take down my thoughts as I think about them. There will not be as much structure to this blog as some in the past, but I want to address how I feel about "Stereotype Threat." Don't know what stereotype threat is? Neither did I, but here are some links that I used to learn enough to form an initial opinion about it:
        <ul>

          <li><a href="http://www.diversityinc.com/diversity-events/the-stereotype-threat-dr-claude-steele-mesmerizes-audience-video/">The Stereotype Threat to Workplace Diversity</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/thin-ice-stereotype-threat-and-black-college-students/304663/">Thin Ice: Stereotype Threat and Black College Students</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>What Dr. Claude Steele is proposing is that there is this idea called "Stereotype Threat" that can prevent individuals from performing/achieving to the best of their ability. It is the burden on one's mind that they might simply fit in or confirm a negative stereotype. The threat, itself, causes that individual to underperform.</p>
        <p>Now, how does this affect me? I don't know if it has. Something that I have definitely thought about is the Asian-bad-driving stereotype. Sometimes I feel like there is a level of anxiety when driving. If I do something stupid, someone honks at me, and they drive past me; I have the sinking feeling that they are just thinking, "Of course he's Asian." I have told this to friends as more of a joke; I mean, I was not intentionally putting myself in danger, but if I was less anxious would I have not done the same thing (and really, I'm only half, so how much of it actually counts towards this stereotype)? Just learning about stereotype threat, this is the first thing that I was drawn too, simply because I have thought about it before learning about Steele's stereotype threat. Talking about my stereotype seems a bit silly when Steele was researching Blacks in academia, but it is just something that I can relate to.</p>
        <p>I like to think that I am in control of how I interact with things, and my age, gender, or ethnicity does not have anything to do it. Usually when I get anxiety, it is about meeting expectations, but I feel like that can be anyone. I don't think that I should get a better math score because I'm Asian. If I am confident, I would think that I should get a better math score because I put in the extra time to learn the material. Basically, even though I have thought about the affects of stereotype threats with my driving skills, I would not want to blame my underperformance on it.</p>
        <p>Because of how I feel about stereotype threat, if I were to help someone else going through it, I don't know if I would address the "threat" directly. I would address how the person deals with the anxiety: If you are nervous when taking a test, stop yourself for a few seconds, take a deep breath, and push forward. I would also try to boost their confidence, or try to help them be more confident the next time. This could also be me being naive. It might not be as simple as I am thinking about it (or how I think about it), but I would like to believe that reducing anxiety and boosting confidence will still help the person grow.</p>
        <p>Trying to wrap up my thoughts, I feel like I took a very negative view towards this topic, but I really did not want it to be that way. I want to take ownership for my success of the lack there of. I do not want wait for society to change on how they stereotype, I want to push past it and excel.</p>
