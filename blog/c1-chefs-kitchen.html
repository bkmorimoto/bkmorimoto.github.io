      I watched a video from <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef Bishay</a> (founder of Dev Bootcamp) discussing the history and culture that has developed at Dev Bootcamp over time. Based on the first section of the video, he talks about the idea of restaurant vs. kitchen. In short, restaurant: I order something off the menu, receive product/services, pay bill (consumer mind set); kitchen: We are all cooks in the kitchen together, getting our hands dirty, working, and learning. I have to say that before I watched the video, I did think about Dev Bootcamp as a menu item. I was paying the money to learn a certain skill set and get my foot in the door in the field. Knowing that the environment is more setup for me take charge of my own education, work with people, learn with people, struggle with people makes it more attractive to me.

      I see it as a way to build comradery since everyone is in the same boat with the same goals. We are all working to better ourselves as both developers and people, rather than focusing on tests and grades. At my last job, there was a taste of this. When I had to learn something new, the drive came from the want to better support my clients in the future. Also, I could help the next person along if when they needed to learn the same thing. I am excited that this time, in Dev Bootcamp, my drive comes from getting to learn something that I want to learn.

      My expectations for the technical side are the same, but it was still good to hear about parity of fears coming into Dev Bootcamp. I also now have a better gauge on what to expect from being on-site and working with the people there. I think the relationships between the students and teachers will be stronger than I had initially thought. I want to be a part of this experiment, and I want to see how I react to it. I cannot say if it will all click with me, but I will not shun it before I try it.
