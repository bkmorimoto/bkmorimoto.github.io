      <h1>Learning about Net Neutrality</h1>
      <h3>Short and sweet</h3>
      <h4>2/8/15</h4>
      <div class="text-content">
        <p>Since there has been some talk about net neutrality recently, I decided to read up on it.</p>
        <p>First, I want to talk about what net neutrality is, because I did not really know what it was beyond "Internet freedom." What it comes down to is that all internet traffic must be treated equally. It is targeted at internet service providers (ISPs) to prevent them from blocking websites and throttling internet traffic to take away from the consumer's experience. I think it is important for us, as consumers, to be wary of what could potentially happen if net neutrality does not actually become a thing. I do not want to come off as too much of a conspiracy theorist, but it is nice to know that the ISPs will not have complete control over what is being seen on the internet, and that there are people fighting for the common people.</p>
        <p>There are a couple other topics that net neutrality would cover in its current state. It would prevent any paid priorization from ISPs so that there is no incentive for them to favor some traffic over others. There is a another generic code of coduct established to prevent any future policies from being instilled that would put the consumers at risk. The ISPs need to be transparant on the services they are providing and how they run their networks; hopefully to prevent any shenanigans that might be going on behind the scenes. The last piece was a little vague in the articles that I read, but it boils down to ths ISPs "reasonably" managing their networks. It is understood that sometimes ISPs need to redistribute available bandwidth to the more important types of data (videos) when the system is overloaded to provide a better user experience. So it just needs to be on reasonable terms, but I am still curious what this will actually mean in the legislation.</p>
        <p>I enjoyed going through and learning more about net neutrality, even if it was on a very basic scale. It is good to see that the government is really trying to find out what ISPs are doing and offering us. The fact that ISPs are fighting net neutrality does not sit with me well, and on a personal note, I cannot wait for someone to revolutionize the internet providers as we know them; they just need to break the mold. Google can definitely do it with Google Fiber, but since it is only offered in limited cities right now, I am not too sure when it will be available nationwide. With someone new in the market, it will hopefully push ISPs to a something new and better. I feel like this with eventually be the solution to issues with net neutrality, and we will not have to worry about <span class="italics">them</span> taking away our freedom.</p>
