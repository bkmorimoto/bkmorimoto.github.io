    <h5>What are the benefits of version control?</h5>
    <p>
      Version control is used to keep track of all changes that are made to a project so that they can be managed. Developers use version control to help with implementing new features without breaking the current code. Because the changes are being tracked, it is easy to roll back to previous versions if anything were to go wrong and stop working. It also helps when collaborating with other developers because you can have multiple people touching different parts of the code without risking one person overwriting the work of someone else. Instead of everyone working on the master branch, everyone works on their own branch and then merges it into the master branch when ready.
    </p>
    <h5>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h5>
    <p>
        You can use 'git status' to track when changes have been made compared to your last commit. From there, you can then selectively add or remove the changes that you actually want to save to the next commit; this is known as the staging phase. Once you have verified the files that have been changed, you can save those changes by performing a 'commit'. This is the actual save of the files. You typically add a comment to the commit so that it is clear what the commit was for (adding a new feature, fixing a bug, etc.). From here, you can use 'git log' to look at all the commits that have been made over time. This is where you can truly see when the changes were made and, with a good comment system, know what was actually changed. Each commit has a relevant commit ID, which can be used to restore the code to what it was at the time of the commit.
    </p>
    <h5>Why use GitHub to store code?</h5>
    <p>
        GitHub has established itself as a stable community where developers can store their code for other people to access. If you are working on a collaborative project, you can use GitHub to manage the merges from multiple users/branches. If you have a product that you want to share with the community, you can place it on GitHub so that others can take a copy of it to use themselves or to even add on to it. And, in general, it has a nice enough UI to manage all your own repositories, search for other repositories, and explore what else is out there.
