        <p>The journey continues as I stuggle to put my thoughts into words on the Stereotype Threat topic (<a href="c6-stereotype-threat.html">last week's culture blog</a>). So we are going to talk about what Dr. Steele considers to be a remedy to combat sterotype threat, affirmation. Well, I would say that is rather obvious. What is the best way to help someone struggling with low confidence and anxiety? Encourage and support them; or, on a personal level, remind yourself what you are good at, what you value, and that will help you get through it.</p>
        <p>What do <span class="italics">I</span> value? DBC provided a list of 100 values, and I chose a few that represent when I am at my proudest:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Competence - 4</li>
          <li>Effectiveness/Efficiency - 3</li>
          <li>Integrity - 4</li>
          <li>Quality - 4</li>
          <li>Responsibility - 4</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="italics">The scale is from 1 to 5 of how much I try to live up to these values</span></p>
        <p>I chose this group of values when thinking about successes in my last job working as tech support for electronic medical record (EMR) software. I often times worked with other people, whether it was co-workers on an internal project or customer-side IT to help them understand our software. In both cases, I wanted to put in quality work to be as productive as possible. Really, it is having respect for the other person's time, so you need to make sure you are pushing yourself to provide to the best of your ability. Part of it is also to know when you are not at your best and rescheduling to another time where you can be more productive. I try to do my best to keep the quality of my code up to my standards (at least), and am trying to improve the level of quality as I navigate DBC.</p>
        <p>When I was back home during the holidays, my dad asked me what the best HDMI streaming device on the market was. I did not know; at the time, I knew about the Chromecast and the Amazon FireTV Stick for budget devices. So, I just did some simple online research and found a third competitor, the Roku stick. I read a few different tech articles to try to filter through the bull shit, and told my dad that the Roku stick was the best bet for what he wanted. Now, why did I tell this little story, besides it being part of the assignment? Even with the a rather mundane decision to be made, I felt obligated to learn about the subject before giving any advice. I would never want to make a misinformed decision, so why would I make one for my dad. He trusted in me to make the smart choice, so I took it upon myself to do so (and also, I am his son).</p>
        <p>I still do not really think that I am really affected by stereotype threats, at least not in the DBC setting. I am affected by many other stress inducers (meeting deadlines, talking in front of big crowds, etc.), and for me, it comes down being smart and confident to set myself up to succeed. If I fall behind, it is knowing that I can ask for help. If I maintain my listed values, then I am sure that DBC would be a breeze, but that is not likely at all. It would be arrogant to say that I will be able to stay on top of everything. For me, I think what will help me the most is seeing my cohortmates every day and having the opportunity to engage in conversation. It goes back to some of my earlier culture blogs: we are all in the same boat, and we will support each other along the way.</p>
