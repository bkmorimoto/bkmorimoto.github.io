    <h1>Arrays and Hashes:</h1>
    <h2>When to and when not to</h2>
    <h4>1/30/15</h4>

    <section>
      <p>This week during Deb Bootcamp, we learned about arrays, hashes, and how we can use them to store certain types of information. Arrays were something I knew about from prior programming work, but I had not been exposed to hashes as much.</p>
      <p>An array is an ordered list of objects that is indexed by its place in the list. In Ruby, the indexing starts at 0, 1, 2, etc., which might be different that one would expect. This means that the first object in the array is stored in the 0th position, the second object is stored in the 1st position. Instead of having to remember where everything is in the list, you could programatically interate through the list and dispaly outputs.</p>
      array1 = [1, 2, 3]
