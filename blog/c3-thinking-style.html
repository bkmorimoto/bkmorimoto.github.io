      <h1>My Take on My Own Thinking Style</h1>

        <p>I took the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Gregorc Thinking Style</a> quiz during the first week of phase 0 to get a better understanding of how I think/learn. I came out of the quiz as an abstract sequential learner. The quiz site simply states that these types of thinkers "love the world of theory and abstract thought." Kind of vague if you ask me, so I did some additional research.</p>
        <p>After going through the first few links googling "abstract sequential thinking," I came across a few interesting points that would relate to my work at DBC. Abstract sequential (AS) thinkers like to be sure of themselves before they act; which means that an appropriate amount of research must be done before committing to a task. They also like to work alone because they like to follow systematic procedures to get to where they need to. I am still using "they" because I do not like putting myself in a box, although, I can definitely relate to these qualities, it is still a little weird for me to admit it.</p>
        <p>Knowing this, I feel like I will have to be sure to address these issues during pair programming. It seems to be the most obvious time where I would have conflicts with the AS thinking. When paired, I do not always have the luxury to do things "my" way because the work now becomes an interactive process. Instead of spending time researching, I am now discussing the topic with my partner (and obviously it does not prohibit us from spending time researching, the idea is that we are engaging each other). Outside of this, I can see myself planning ahead and allocating time for prep/research for future assignments if I see fit. By doing this I hope to create a more comfortable environment for me to learn.</p>
        <p>I have enjoyed the work (both technical and cultural) during the first unit of DBC. So far I have had some background in the topics we have covered, but I have still learned quite a bit on top of my previous knowledge, and it has helped reinforce what was already there. My biggest concern was pair programming because I have never worked that closely with someone on relatively short assignments. You barely get to know the person, yet you rely on them to help get the challenge done. Even in the first few weeks, I have had experiences that have changed my thoughts on them in a positive way. I want to meet and pair with someone different just to get a feel of how I jive with them. I can see how I react to different situations and hopefully grow as a person from each pairing session. I would say that I am a pretty stubborn person, but during this process, I am trying to be more open about the new ideas that DBC has presented to me, mainly because that is the whole point of this, right?</p>
        <p>Being "forced" (for lack of a better term) into situations and challenges in DBC have already caused me to second guess things. I will take pair programming as an example again. I have always thought that I am more efficient when I work by myself because there is not someone else there to slow me down. If I am by myself, I do not have to explain myself along the way; as long as the final product is effective, than I am good to go. Now, I feel like this thought process is too short term: with pair programming, I have learned that you can find errors/bugs right away, which may cut down on overall development time. You can also foster a different, better way to do something; something that I might have not thought of myself. It is having respect for your pair that enables you to unlock the true potential of pair programming (sounds like something straight out of a comic book), and I never really saw it like this. As I mentioned before, I do not want to claim that I am an AS thinker, but it is what the test said I am, and I am curious how my Gregorc style will change by the end of DBC. I am sure there will be a balance of soaking up these cultural tidbits as well as maintaining who I am, as I know myself, today.</p>
