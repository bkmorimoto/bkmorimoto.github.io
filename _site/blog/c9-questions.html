      <h3>Asking good questions</h3>

        <p>So far, during my DBC experience, I had not asked many technical questions in a written format. Looking to the community for some examples, there are definitely questions that are better than others, but I never thought about it too much. The questions that I looked to answer in the Google+ community were ones with a code snippet or at least a link to their challenge solution on GitHub. I would say that it is very hard to try to address all questions a potential answerer might have within a single post, and an example of code can clear some of those things up. When I saw questions without examples, I often found myself having too many questions about what is trying to be done. If I had the time, I would just hop into a Google hangout so that we can look at the code together, and I could get a better picture of what was going on. But if I did not have the time, it is kind of tedious to write out all the relevant questions I had in a reply, then have to wait for the original poster to respond, and finally have to come back to it and respond. These are the types of questions that I skipped over. And I realize that I am generalizing "technical" questions, because there were plenty of reasonable questions asked that did not require a code snippet, but I was, in general, more interested in the coding questions to get a glimpse of other people's code styles while looking into the question.</p>
        <p>Coming from an IT background, I have some experience with forming and asking the right questions, and also how to help people get the answer they want by putting some more thought into a question before they ask it. I had countless experiences where I got emails with something like, "When I was working on X, Y functionality was broken." The first few times you deal with it, and probe the client for more information, but after a while it gets frustrating. There is the potential of a lot of loss time inbetween email responses: I have to respond where I ask more detailed questions about what was actually going on, then they have to respond with the details, and so on (Basically, the same reason why I was turned off by some of the community questions). Because of this, I am a strong supporter about doing your due dilligence and learning how to ask better questions.</p>
        <p>For me, it comes down to a few things necessary to ask a "good" question:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Do some research on the topic beforehand. There is a lot of information out in the internet, and depending on your field, your question is probably not unique. Make sure it has not been answered before.</li>
          <li>Include some background on what you are trying to accomplish and what method you have chosen to address it (the why also helps)</li>
          <li>Include some examples of what you were trying to do, what you expected, and the result you got in the failed attempt.</li>
          <li>Something that I think is important after reading through some additional resources about asking questions: have a good title. On something like stackoverflow, it is important to capture the attention of people with your title and at the same time provide enough information so that the person knows what they need to address. (This is vague, but check out the first link in the resources below for some more insight on a "good" title)</li>
          <li>Lastly, be humble. You are asking people for help. Do not try show off how smart you are, do not talk down to your audience, just ask the question and be ready to address any responses that come up.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here are a couple links that I went through to prepare for this blog entry. They go into some detail on the points that I mentioned here, and might help build a better foundation on how to ask a good question:</p>
