        <p>My DBC experience so far has been great. It is very different from trying to teach yourself a language through online tutorials because we are forced to interact with each other (which is definitely not a bad thing).</p>
        <p>One of the things that I was nervous about was pairing. I did a fair amount of programming in my last job, but I had never actually done paired programming like we are doing now. I was so used to just having to translate my ideas into code without really having to explain myself (I let my code do the talking), but with a partner, that all gets turned upside down. I still struggle from time to time to explain my thoughts on a particular code block because I usually just get caught up on what the downstream effects are, and I will not actually finish explaining my thought. This is what I have been trying to work on the most: I either have to think things through a little more before I start talking, or be ready to talk everything through completely so my pair can get where I am coming from. So even though I can get caught up in my own head, everyone that I have worked with so far has been very patient with me, and I have always come out of a pairing session with positive feelings. It is great to just work with other people, learn different coding styles, how other people approach the same problem I am dealing with, and, often times, learning some cool new tricks. The downside for me, still, is that I feel like it takes longer for both parties to explain each other. Sometimes I am in a mood to just turn on some music and blast through challenges, but you cannot do this with a pair. I think that is just the natrual trade-off. You are getting the insight of a peer to enchance you code, and because the quality of the code is likely to improve, there is the necessary time investment.</p>
        <p>For the feedback piece of DBC, I still find it the hardest thing to get through on a week-to-week basis. The A.S.K. criteria makes you really think about what you should address in the feedback. It is easy to write fluff pieces as feedback, but that is not what we are doing here. We are trying to help each other improve by being honest with each other when something comes up during a pair session. I also stuggle when giving constructive feedback because I do not want to come off as a jerk, but this is also part of the process of both writing and reading feedback. When reading feedback, you really have to have the mindset that we are all in the same boat. No one enjoys writing negative feedback (at least I hope not), so if I read some about myself, I would know that it is something that I really need to work on to give the person credit for being honest with me. Reading through the feedback that I have received so far, I have learned that my state of mind definitely has an affect on how I interact and how productive I am. The sessions that I know I was tired or simply "out of it," were reflected in the feedback that I got for those. To help with that, I consider the pairing sessions a little more when I see a request on the Google+ community. At first, I was just too eager, and I did not want to miss the opportunity (or get left behind). Now I know that there is plenty of time to actually get pairing sessions done, and I should really pick them wisely. I also feel like reading through the feedback I received really gives me some perspective on how to improve the feedback I give. I think I will continue to struggle with this for a while, but I am working on it with the help of the meta feedback.</p>
