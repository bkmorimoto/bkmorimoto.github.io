      <h1>Analyzing Conflict</h1>
      <h3>Ghosts from my last job</h3>
      <h4>3/8/15</h4>
      <div class="text-content">
        <p>When I think about conflicts, it is easy to pull stories from my last job. One of the more common scenarios in my technical support job was to figure out what was best for the customer while still following all the standard processes set up at the workplace. The processes were often times frustrating, because it just seemed like a lot red tape that prohibited me from providing the best support that I could.</p>
        <p>There was one case where I had done some custom development for a customer to customize how the format of their bills looked. A few days before they were going to start using the bill, they wanted a format change. Now, the standard developement process normally takes a couple weeks for me to get all the right approvals, schedule QA time, and it is just a whole mess. It was particularly upsetting because the actual code change itself was just adding a single line of code. It was not the easiest thing to explain to the customer why it would take so long, because they just wanted their bills to be fixed.</p>
        <p>For about a day, there were a lot of uncomfortable calls and emails to try to get the customer to understand why it would take so long, but they were still left unsatisfied. I was the mediator, and it just felt awful giving them such bad news. I then decided to escalate the situation and work with my team leader to get the quickest turn around on the development as I could. It required a handful of phone calls to the right people, walking to offices to catch people for signatures, and promises of candy to help get the testing done quicker, but I was able to line up all the resources necessary to get the development to the customer within the week.</p>
        <p>It felt good to tell the customer that we were able to get everything done ahead of schedule and deliver the updated code. They were thankful for the extra work that we put in to get the job done, and it was a good feeling to know that I made some kind of difference for them. The one issue with this was setting a precedence that we COULD get the development done quicker than initially promised, and if they pushed hard enough, we could then produce (hopefully). And now you are stuck with a week turn around time when there is still a standard 2-week turn around time for small fixes. If I could do it over, I think I would still do the same thing that I did, but I would still feel bad about establishing an inappropriate precedence.</p>
        <p>I learned a couple things: I could get people moving if I talked to the right people and that processes are set up for a reason (even if I hated going through all the red tape). I still was very satisfied that I could produced "unexpected" results for my customer, but it still left a bad taste in my mouth. And luckily, it never came back to bite me.</p>
