        <p>This is my first entry of my blog that is left a little more open-ended. All the previous posts have been directly related to some kind of assignment, teaching you about something, or reacting to a piece of media. I just want to reflect on how I have felt building this website over the course of phase 0 of DBC.</p>
        <p>It was a slow process since I had very little experience with HTML and CSS and had never come close to building a website before. Once I started to learn more: new HTML tricks, figuring out positioning, and getting a feel for my own style, the website started to come together. It started to feel more like an actual website, and it came with a feeling of excitement and proudness. I had built this. I had learned something new, and built this.</p>
        <p>Now, there were still frustrating points along the way. For me it was figuring out where to put everything on the page. We had learned how to wireframe before starting this project, but I deviated from my initial wireframe relatively quickly. While trying to figure everything out, I was struggling with the CSS to actually get things where they needed to be. It felt like I was dumping a lot of time into trial and error with very little to show for it, and that was exactly the case. But this is still part of the process, and it is easy to lose sight of that. Again, this is the first site that I built, so there is going to be a learning curve, but it is hard to hold onto that when your divs are jumping all over the screen when you do not want them to. It is a matter of pushing through it and knowing that you have learned something because of the struggle.</p>
        <p>The next exciting thing is what we are going to learn next. We took a very caveman-approach to build this website. Generating all the HTML and CSS from scratch when there are easier way to handle them. This is what intrigues me: what are we going to be able to do by the end of DBC. What advanced tricks are out there to generate something like this (and probably even better) with a few simple tools and commands. I am sure I will have some time later to reflect back to this moment, where I had put so many hours into this site, and realize how simple it still is. We will see what happens.</p>
